<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Goals are “needs of the target organization, which the system will
address”. While the development team is the principal user of the other
books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all
stakeholders. It must contain enough information to provide — if read
just by itself — a general sketch of the entire project. To this effect,
chapter G.3 presents a short overview of the system, and G1 will
typically include some key properties of the environment. As it
addresses a wide readership, it should be clear and minimize the use of
specialized technical terms. Together, G1, G2 and G3 describe the
rationale for the project. It is important to state these justifications
explicitly. Typically, they are well understood at the start of the
project, but management and priorities can change (see <a
href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-06739-6">Handbook</a>).</p>
<h3 id="g.1-overall-context-and-goals">G.1 Overall context and
goals</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Many libraries still use outdated systems
that slow down daily tasks. This project defines the requirements for a
simple, modern Library Management System (LMS) to improve how books and
users are managed.The goal is to build a clear, adaptable foundation for
future development.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> <code>G.1.1</code> Simplify Lending: To
streamline the process of checking out and returning books across
different library branches, making the workflow efficient for staff and
seamless for users.</p>
<p><code>G.1.2</code> Enhance Accessibility: To provide a clear,
user-friendly interface that allows patrons to easily search the
catalog, place holds, and manage their account status without requiring
constant staff intervention.</p>
<p><code>G.1.3</code> Ensure Fair Access: To automatically enforce
borrowing rules—such as loan limits, reservation queues, and return
deadlines—ensuring that library resources remain available to the widest
possible audience.</p>
<h3 id="g.2-current-situation">G.2 Current situation</h3>
<p><code>G.2.1</code> Manual Processes: Librarians often rely on manual
record-keeping or disconnected legacy software, leading to
inefficiencies in tracking book locations and user status.</p>
<p><code>G.2.2</code> Lack of Autonomy: Users cannot check real-time
availability or manage their loans remotely, forcing them to visit the
library or contact staff for simple queries.</p>
<p><code>G.2.3</code> Process Definition: The structure and specific
feature sets for the digital transformation are currently being defined
to replace these obsolete methods.</p>
<p><code>G.2.4</code> Poor Visibility: Members have limited visibility
regarding book availability and their own borrowing status.</p>
<h3 id="g.3-expected-benefits">G.3 Expected benefits</h3>
<p><code>G.3.1</code> Improved accuracy and consistency in tracking
books, copies, and loans.</p>
<p><code>G.3.2</code> Clear enforcement of library policies such as loan
periods and borrowing limits.</p>
<p><code>G.3.3</code> Reduced manual effort for librarians through
automation of routine operations.</p>
<p><code>G.3.4</code> Better user experience for members through
transparent access to borrowing information.</p>
<p><code>G.3.5</code> A shared and reliable source of truth about the
state of the library inventory.</p>
<h3 id="g.4-functionality-overview">G.4 Functionality overview</h3>
<p><code>G.4.1</code> Manage the library catalog (books and their
physical copies).</p>
<p><code>G.4.2</code> Register and manage library members.</p>
<p><code>G.4.3</code> Handle borrowing, returning, and tracking of
loans.</p>
<p><code>G.4.4</code> Enforce lending rules and constraints.</p>
<p><code>G.4.5</code> Provide visibility into availability, loan status,
and overdue items.</p>
<p><code>G.4.6</code> Detailed behavior and technical design choices are
intentionally deferred to later sections.</p>
<h3 id="g.5-high-level-usage-scenarios">G.5 High-level usage
scenarios</h3>
<p><code>G.5.1</code> A librarian registers new books and copies into
the system.</p>
<p><code>G.5.2</code> A member searches for a book and checks its
availability.</p>
<p><code>G.5.3</code> A member borrows an available copy following
library rules.</p>
<p><code>G.5.4</code> A member returns a borrowed copy.</p>
<p><code>G.5.5</code> A librarian reviews overdue loans and current
inventory status.</p>
<h3 id="g.6-limitations-and-exclusions">G.6 Limitations and
exclusions</h3>
<p>The system is not required to address the following aspects:</p>
<p><code>G.6.1</code> Financial management (payments, fines processing,
accounting).</p>
<p><code>G.6.2</code> Acquisition workflows with publishers or
suppliers.</p>
<p><code>G.6.3</code> Detailed analytics or recommendation engines.
Physical security systems (RFID gates, surveillance).</p>
<p><code>G.6.4</code> Full digital content delivery (e-book readers, DRM
platforms).</p>
<h3 id="g.7-stakeholders-and-requirements-sources">G.7 Stakeholders and
requirements sources</h3>
<p>Primary stakeholders include:</p>
<p><code>G.7.1</code> Library members, who borrow and return books.</p>
<p><code>G.7.2</code> Librarians, responsible for catalog management and
daily operations.</p>
<p><code>G.7.3</code> Library administrators, who define policies and
oversee operations.</p>
<p><code>G.7.4</code> Development team, responsible for designing and
implementing the system.</p>
<p>Requirements are derived from:</p>
<p><code>G.7.5</code> Common library operational practices.</p>
<p><code>G.7.6</code> Domain-driven design principles applied to library
systems.</p>
<p><code>G.7.7</code> Educational and reference material on library
management system design.</p>
