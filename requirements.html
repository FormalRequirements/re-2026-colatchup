<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Goals are “needs of the target organization, which the system will
address”. While the development team is the principal user of the other
books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all
stakeholders. It must contain enough information to provide — if read
just by itself — a general sketch of the entire project. To this effect,
chapter G.3 presents a short overview of the system, and G1 will
typically include some key properties of the environment. As it
addresses a wide readership, it should be clear and minimize the use of
specialized technical terms. Together, G1, G2 and G3 describe the
rationale for the project. It is important to state these justifications
explicitly. Typically, they are well understood at the start of the
project, but management and priorities can change (see <a
href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-06739-6">Handbook</a>).</p>
<h3 id="g.1-overall-context-and-goals">G.1 Overall context and
goals</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Many libraries still use outdated systems
that slow down daily tasks. This project defines the requirements for a
simple, modern Library Management System (LMS) to improve how books and
users are managed.The goal is to build a clear, adaptable foundation for
future development.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> <code>G.1.1</code> Simplify Lending: To
streamline the process of checking out and returning books across
different library branches, making the workflow efficient for staff and
seamless for users.</p>
<p><code>G.1.2</code> Enhance Accessibility: To provide a clear,
user-friendly interface that allows patrons to easily search the
catalog, place holds, and manage their account status without requiring
constant staff intervention.</p>
<p><code>G.1.3</code> Ensure Fair Access: To automatically enforce
borrowing rules—such as loan limits, reservation queues, and return
deadlines—ensuring that library resources remain available to the widest
possible audience.</p>
<h3 id="g.2-current-situation">G.2 Current situation</h3>
<p><code>G.2.1</code> Manual Processes: Librarians often rely on manual
record-keeping or disconnected legacy software, leading to
inefficiencies in tracking book locations and user status.</p>
<p><code>G.2.2</code> Lack of Autonomy: Users cannot check real-time
availability or manage their loans remotely, forcing them to visit the
library or contact staff for simple queries.</p>
<p><code>G.2.3</code> Process Definition: The structure and specific
feature sets for the digital transformation are currently being defined
to replace these obsolete methods.</p>
<p><code>G.2.4</code> Poor Visibility: Members have limited visibility
regarding book availability and their own borrowing status.</p>
<h3 id="g.3-expected-benefits">G.3 Expected benefits</h3>
<p><code>G.3.1</code> Improved accuracy and consistency in tracking
books, copies, and loans.</p>
<p><code>G.3.2</code> Clear enforcement of library policies such as loan
periods and borrowing limits.</p>
<p><code>G.3.3</code> Reduced manual effort for librarians through
automation of routine operations.</p>
<p><code>G.3.4</code> Better user experience for members through
transparent access to borrowing information.</p>
<p><code>G.3.5</code> A shared and reliable source of truth about the
state of the library inventory.</p>
<h3 id="g.4-functionality-overview">G.4 Functionality overview</h3>
<p><code>G.4.1</code> Manage the library catalog (books and their
physical copies).</p>
<p><code>G.4.2</code> Register and manage library members.</p>
<p><code>G.4.3</code> Handle borrowing, returning, and tracking of
loans.</p>
<p><code>G.4.4</code> Enforce lending rules and constraints.</p>
<p><code>G.4.5</code> Provide visibility into availability, loan status,
and overdue items.</p>
<p><code>G.4.6</code> Detailed behavior and technical design choices are
intentionally deferred to later sections.</p>
<h3 id="g.5-high-level-usage-scenarios">G.5 High-level usage
scenarios</h3>
<p><code>G.5.1</code> A librarian registers new books and copies into
the system.</p>
<p><code>G.5.2</code> A member searches for a book and checks its
availability.</p>
<p><code>G.5.3</code> A member borrows an available copy following
library rules.</p>
<p><code>G.5.4</code> A member returns a borrowed copy.</p>
<p><code>G.5.5</code> A librarian reviews overdue loans and current
inventory status.</p>
<h3 id="g.6-limitations-and-exclusions">G.6 Limitations and
exclusions</h3>
<p>The system is not required to address the following aspects:</p>
<p><code>G.6.1</code> Financial management (payments, fines processing,
accounting).</p>
<p><code>G.6.2</code> Acquisition workflows with publishers or
suppliers.</p>
<p><code>G.6.3</code> Detailed analytics or recommendation engines.
Physical security systems (RFID gates, surveillance).</p>
<p><code>G.6.4</code> Full digital content delivery (e-book readers, DRM
platforms).</p>
<h3 id="g.7-stakeholders-and-requirements-sources">G.7 Stakeholders and
requirements sources</h3>
<p>Primary stakeholders include:</p>
<p><code>G.7.1</code> Library members, who borrow and return books.</p>
<p><code>G.7.2</code> Librarians, responsible for catalog management and
daily operations.</p>
<p><code>G.7.3</code> Library administrators, who define policies and
oversee operations.</p>
<p><code>G.7.4</code> Development team, responsible for designing and
implementing the system.</p>
<p>Requirements are derived from:</p>
<p><code>G.7.5</code> Common library operational practices.</p>
<p><code>G.7.6</code> Domain-driven design principles applied to library
systems.</p>
<p><code>G.7.7</code> Educational and reference material on library
management system design.</p>
<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>This section describes the context in which the Library Management
System operates. It focuses on the real-world elements of a library, the
rules that govern it, and the assumptions made about how it functions.
The goal is to clearly define the domain independently of any technical
implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e.1-glossary">E.1 Glossary</h3>
<p><strong>Library:</strong> An organization that manages a collection
of books and allows registered users to borrow them.</p>
<p><strong>Book:</strong> A published work identified by information
such as title, author, and ISBN.</p>
<p><strong>Copy:</strong> A physical instance of a book that can be
borrowed by a member.</p>
<p><strong>Member:</strong> A registered user of the library who is
allowed to borrow books.</p>
<p><strong>Librarian:</strong> A staff member responsible for managing
the library’s collection and supervising borrowing activities.</p>
<p><strong>Loan:</strong> The action of lending a book copy to a member
for a limited period.</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> The state of a copy indicating whether
it can currently be borrowed.</p>
<p><strong>Loan policy:</strong> A set of rules defining how long and
how many books a member can borrow.</p>
<h3 id="e.2-components">E.2 Components</h3>
<p><code>E.2.1</code>The environment of the system includes several
real-world elements:</p>
<p><code>E.2.2</code>A collection of books composed of multiple physical
copies.</p>
<p><code>E.2.3</code>People interacting with the library, such as
members and librarians.</p>
<p><code>E.2.4</code>Rules defined by the library regarding borrowing
and returning books.</p>
<p><code>E.2.5</code>Time-related aspects, including loan durations and
due dates.</p>
<p><code>E.2.6</code>These elements exist regardless of the system and
are simply represented and managed by it.</p>
<h3 id="e.3-constraints">E.3 Constraints</h3>
<p><code>E.3.1</code>The Library Management System must respect the
following constraints:</p>
<p><code>E.3.2</code>A physical copy can only be loaned to one member at
a time.</p>
<p><code>E.3.3</code>Borrowing conditions, such as loan duration and
maximum number of loans, are defined by the library.</p>
<p><code>E.3.4</code>Only registered members are allowed to borrow
books.</p>
<p><code>E.3.5</code>Librarians are responsible for keeping the catalog
accurate and up to date.</p>
<p><code>E.3.6</code>The system must always reflect real library
operations consistently.</p>
<h3 id="e.4-assumptions">E.4 Assumptions</h3>
<p><code>E.4.1</code>The following assumptions are made about the
environment:</p>
<p><code>E.4.2</code>Each book can be uniquely identified using standard
metadata.</p>
<p><code>E.4.3</code>Physical copies are tracked individually.</p>
<p><code>E.4.4</code>Members follow the library’s rules when borrowing
and returning books.</p>
<p><code>E.4.5</code>Library policies do not change frequently.</p>
<p><code>E.4.6</code>The system is initially designed for a single
library.</p>
<h3 id="e.5-effects">E.5 Effects</h3>
<p><code>E.5.1</code>The introduction of the system has several effects
on the library environment:</p>
<p><code>E.5.2</code>Manual tracking of loans and inventory is
reduced.</p>
<p><code>E.5.3</code>Information about availability and loan status
becomes more accessible.</p>
<p><code>E.5.4</code>Lending rules are applied more consistently.</p>
<p><code>E.5.5</code>Communication between members and librarians is
improved.</p>
<p><code>E.5.6</code>The system supports existing processes without
changing the library’s policies.</p>
<h3 id="e.6-invariants">E.6 Invariants</h3>
<p><code>E.6.1</code>The following properties must always remain
true:</p>
<p><code>E.6.2</code>A copy cannot be available and on loan at the same
time.</p>
<p><code>E.6.3</code>Each loan is linked to exactly one member and one
copy.</p>
<p><code>E.6.4</code>Once a copy is returned, it becomes available
again.</p>
<p><code>E.6.5</code>The catalog only contains books and copies that
actually exist.</p>
<p><code>E.6.6</code>The system state must always match the real
situation of the library.</p>
<h2 id="system">System</h2>
<p>The System section specifies what the Library Management System must
do and how it is structured from a requirements perspective. It
describes the system’s responsibilities, its internal decomposition, its
interactions with users and external actors, and the criteria used to
verify that requirements are met. This section remains independent of
any specific technical implementation.</p>
<h3 id="s.1-components">S.1 Components</h3>
<p>The Library Management System is composed of the following logical
components:</p>
<p><code>S.1.1</code> Catalog Management Component, responsible for
maintaining information about books and their copies.</p>
<p><code>S.1.2</code> Member Management Component, responsible for
registering and maintaining member data.</p>
<p><code>S.1.3</code> Loan Management Component, responsible for
handling borrowing and returning operations.</p>
<p><code>S.1.4</code> Policy Enforcement Component, responsible for
applying lending rules and constraints.</p>
<p><code>S.1.5</code> User Interaction Component, responsible for
supporting interactions with members and librarians.</p>
<h3 id="s.2-functionality">S.2 Functionality</h3>
<p>The system shall provide the following functionalities:</p>
<p><code>S.2.1</code> Register, update, and consult information about
books and their physical copies.</p>
<p><code>S.2.2</code> Register and manage library members.</p>
<p><code>S.2.3</code> Allow members to borrow available copies according
to library rules.</p>
<p><code>S.2.4</code> Allow members to return borrowed copies.</p>
<p><code>S.2.5</code> Track active loans and their due dates.</p>
<p><code>S.2.6</code> Enforce loan policies such as borrowing limits and
loan duration.</p>
<p><code>S.2.7</code> Provide visibility into availability and loan
status.</p>
<p>All functionalities must operate in a consistent and controlled
manner.</p>
<h3 id="s.3-interfaces">S.3 Interfaces</h3>
<p>The system shall expose interfaces to the following actors:</p>
<p><code>S.3.1</code> Members, who consult the catalog and manage their
own loans.</p>
<p><code>S.3.2</code> Librarians, who manage the catalog and supervise
borrowing operations.</p>
<p><code>S.3.3</code> Administrators, who define or update library
policies.</p>
<p><code>S.3.4</code> These interfaces must provide clear access to
system functionality while respecting user roles and permissions.</p>
<h3 id="s.4-detailed-usage-scenarios">S.4 Detailed usage scenarios</h3>
<p>Typical system usage scenarios include:</p>
<p><code>S.4.1</code> A librarian registers a new book and its copies in
the catalog.</p>
<p><code>S.4.2</code> A member searches for a book and checks copy
availability.</p>
<p><code>S.4.3</code> A member borrows an available copy, creating a
loan record.</p>
<p><code>S.4.4</code> A member returns a borrowed copy, closing the
loan.</p>
<p><code>S.4.5</code> A librarian reviews current loans and identifies
overdue items.</p>
<p>Each scenario must result in a consistent update of the system
state.</p>
<h3 id="s.5-prioritization">S.5 Prioritization</h3>
<p>System functionalities are prioritized as follows:</p>
<p><code>S.5.1</code> High priority: Loan management, catalog
management, member registration.</p>
<p><code>S.5.2</code> Medium priority: Policy enforcement and
availability tracking.</p>
<p><code>S.5.3</code> Low priority: Administrative reporting and
extended consultation features.</p>
<p>Higher-priority functionalities must be implemented and validated
first.</p>
<h3 id="s.6-verification-and-acceptance-criteria">S.6 Verification and
acceptance criteria</h3>
<p>The system shall be considered acceptable when:</p>
<p><code>S.6.1</code> All defined functionalities are implemented and
operational.</p>
<p><code>S.6.2</code> Lending rules are consistently enforced.</p>
<p><code>S.6.3</code> System state accurately reflects real-world
library operations.</p>
<p><code>S.6.4</code> Invariants defined in the Environment section are
preserved.</p>
<p><code>S.6.5</code> Usage scenarios can be executed without
inconsistency or data loss.</p>
<p>Verification will be performed through scenario-based testing and
stakeholder validation.</p>
